# pwd

The pwd command (Print Working Directory) displays the full absolute path of the directory you are currently in.   
It is most commonly used in Unix-like operating systems to confirm your location before executing commands that affect files.

## options
- -L: Shows the logical path, including symbolic links.
- -P: Shows the physical path, resolving any symbolic links to the actual directory.

## example
`pwd`

/root
